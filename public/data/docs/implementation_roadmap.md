# Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines a prioritized roadmap for implementing the AI agent capabilities in N8N.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup (Priority: High)

- **1.1. N8N Environment Setup:**
    - [ ] Deploy N8N in a scalable, queue-based configuration.
    - [ ] Configure a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    - [ ] Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for secure access.
- **1.2. Logging and Monitoring:**
    - [ ] Implement a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack) to collect and analyze logs from N8N.
    - [ ] Set up a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor the health and performance of the N8N instance.
- **1.3. Version Control:**
    - [ ] Establish a Git repository for managing N8N workflows and custom nodes.

## Phase 2: Foundational Sub-workflows (Priority: High)

- **2.1. Research Sub-workflow:**
    - [ ] Implement a sub-workflow for performing web searches using various search engine APIs.
    - [ ] Add the capability to extract content from web pages.
    - [ ] Integrate with document reading services (e.g., for PDF and DOCX files).
- **2.2. Content Generation Sub-workflow:**
    - [ ] Integrate with a leading LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI) for text generation.
    - [ ] Add the capability to generate images using a service like DALL-E or Stability AI.

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Priority: Medium)

- **3.1. Web Development Sub-workflow:**
    - [ ] Integrate with the Figma API to import design specifications.
    - [ ] Implement a workflow for generating code using an AI code generation service.
    - [ ] Integrate with a CI/CD tool for automated deployment.
- **3.2. Multi-modal Processing Sub-workflow:**
    - [ ] Integrate with a video generation service.
    - [ ] Integrate with a speech-to-text service.
    - [ ] Integrate with a text-to-speech service.

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Priority: High)

- **4.1. Master Workflow Implementation:**
    - [ ] Implement the master workflow to orchestrate the sub-workflows.
    - [ ] Implement the request parsing and result aggregation logic.
- **4.2. End-to-End Testing:**
    - [ ] Perform thorough end-to-end testing of the entire system.
    - [ ] Create a suite of automated tests to ensure the ongoing reliability of the system.
