# Research Plan: N8N for AI Platform Replication

## 1. Objectives
- To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the N8N platform's capabilities.
- To determine the technical feasibility of replicating the features of Manus.im, Lovable.dev, ChatLLM (Abacus.ai), and the MiniMax Platform using N8N.
- To produce a detailed set of deliverables, including a capabilities analysis, feature mapping, feasibility assessment, recommended workflow architecture, implementation roadmap, and a list of limitations and required external services.

## 2. Research Breakdown

### Phase 1: Platform Analysis Review (Internal)
- **Sub-task 1.1:** Read and synthesize the provided analysis for Manus.im (`extract/manus_analysis.json`).
- **Sub-task 1.2:** Read and synthesize the provided analysis for Lovable.dev (`extract/lovable_analysis.json`).
- **Sub-task 1.3:** Read and synthesize the provided analysis for ChatLLM/Abacus.ai (`extract/abacus_analysis.json`, `extract/chatllm_analysis.json`).
- **Sub-task 1.4:** Read and synthesize the provided analysis for the MiniMax Platform (`extract/minimaxi_analysis.json`).
- **Sub-task 1.5:** Consolidate the key features and capabilities of all platforms into a single summary document.

### Phase 2: N8N In-Depth Research (External)

    - Research available nodes and integrations (AI/ML, APIs, databases, communication).
    - Investigate workflow automation capabilities and limitations.
    - Analyze support for sub-workflows and conditional logic.
    - Study error handling and recovery mechanisms.
    - Explore custom node development possibilities.
    - Assess performance and scalability considerations.
- **Sub-task 2.2:** **AI Service Integrations:**
    - Identify all LLM API integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.).
    - Research support for image/video generation APIs.
    - Investigate speech synthesis and processing capabilities.
    - Analyze how to orchestrate multi-modal AI services.
- **Sub-task 2.3:** **Development and Deployment Capabilities:**
    - Research code execution and testing workflows.
    - Investigate version control integration (GitHub, GitLab).
    - Analyze app/website deployment automation capabilities.
    - Study database operations and data processing.
- **Sub-task 2.4:** **Communication and Integration:**
    - Research Slack, Teams, and Discord integration capabilities.
    - Investigate email and notification systems.
    - Analyze file processing and document generation.
    - Study web scraping and data extraction capabilities.

### Phase 3: Analysis and Design
- **Sub-task 3.1:** **AI Platform Feature Mapping:** Create a detailed mapping of each AI platform's features to specific N8N nodes or workflow patterns.
- **Sub-task 3.2:** **Technical Feasibility Assessment:** For each major capability, assess the technical feasibility of implementation in N8N.
- **Sub-task 3.3:** **Workflow Architecture Design:**
    - Design a master workflow orchestration pattern.
    - Propose a sub-workflow organization for different domains (e.g., research, content generation).
    - Define data flow and state management strategies.
    - Outline parallel processing and optimization techniques.

### Phase 4: Deliverable Generation
- **Sub-task 4.1:** **Detailed N8N Capabilities Analysis:** Write a comprehensive document detailing N8N's capabilities, with links to specific node documentation.
- **Sub-task 4.2:** **Limitations and Workaround Strategies:** Document N8N's limitations and propose workaround strategies.
- **Sub-task 4.3:** **Required External Services and API Integrations:** Compile a list of all necessary external services and APIs.
- **Sub-task 4.4:** **Implementation Roadmap:** Create a prioritized implementation roadmap.
- **Sub-task 4.5:** **Final Report:** Consolidate all deliverables into a final, well-structured report.

## 3. Resource Strategy
- **Primary Sources:** N8N official documentation, N8N community forums, GitHub repositories, and official blog/tutorials.
- **Secondary Sources:** Third-party articles, and video tutorials.
- **Search Keywords:** "N8N [feature name]", "N8N integration [service name]", "N8N custom node development", "N8N workflow examples", "N8N scalability", "N8N error handling".

## 4. Verification Plan
- **Source Triangulation:** Cross-reference information from at least three different sources (official docs, community forums, and independent articles) to validate findings.
- **Practical Verification:** Where possible, I will create small, proof-of-concept workflows to test specific functionalities and verify capabilities.

## 5. Expected Deliverables
1.  `docs/n8n_capabilities_analysis.md`: Detailed N8N capabilities analysis with specific node documentation.
2.  `docs/feature_mapping.md`: AI platform feature mapping to N8N workflow components.
3.  `docs/feasibility_assessment.md`: Technical feasibility assessment for each major capability.
4.  `docs/workflow_architecture.md`: Recommended workflow architecture with sub-workflow organization.
5.  `docs/implementation_roadmap.md`: Implementation roadmap with priority levels.
6.  `docs/limitations_and_workarounds.md`: Limitations and workaround strategies.
7.  `docs/external_services.md`: Required external services and API integrations list.
8.  `docs/final_report.md`: A final report consolidating all research and findings.

## 6. Workflow Selection
- **Primary Focus:** Search and Analysis
- **Justification:** This task requires extensive research and analysis of both the target AI platforms and the N8N platform, followed by a design and planning phase.
