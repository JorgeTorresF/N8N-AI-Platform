{"extracted_information": "Nodes in n8n are the key building blocks of a workflow. They perform actions such as starting the workflow, fetching and sending data, and processing and manipulating data. n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, and users can also create their own or use community-created nodes.\n\nTo add a node to an empty workflow, select 'Add first step' to open the nodes panel and choose a trigger node. For an existing workflow, select the 'Add node' connector to access the nodes panel.\n\nNode operations include two types: Triggers and Actions.\n- Triggers: Start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in connected services. They are identified by a bolt icon.\n- Actions: Represent specific tasks within a workflow, used to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems.\n\nNodes also have controls and settings:\n- Node controls (visible on hover): 'Execute step' (run node), 'Deactivate' (deactivate node), 'Delete' (delete node), and 'Node context menu' for more actions like opening, renaming, pinning, copying, duplicating, selecting, and clearing selection.\n- Node settings (under the 'Settings' tab): Allow control over node behaviors and adding notes. Options include 'Request Options' (Batching, Ignore SSL Issues, Proxy, Timeout), 'Always Output Data' (returns empty item if no data), 'Execute Once' (executes once with first item's data), 'Retry On Fail' (reruns on failure until success), and 'On Error' settings ('Stop Workflow', 'Continue', 'Continue (using error output)'). Users can also add 'Notes' and choose to 'Display note in flow' as a subtitle.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Key building blocks of a workflow", "Start workflows", "Fetch and send data", "Process and manipulate data", "Built-in nodes available", "Supports community-created nodes", "Allows creation of custom nodes", "Node types: Triggers (start workflow, bolt icon) and Actions (perform tasks, manipulate data)", "Node controls: Execute step, Deactivate, Delete, Node context menu (Open, Rename, Pin, Copy, Duplicate, Select, Clear selection)", "Node settings: Request Options (Batching, Ignore SSL Issues, Proxy, Timeout)", "Node settings: Always Output Data, Execute Once, Retry On Fail", "Node settings: On Error handling (Stop Workflow, Continue, Continue (using error output))", "Node settings: Notes and Display note in flow"], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
