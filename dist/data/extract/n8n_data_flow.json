{"extracted_information": "n8n nodes are capable of processing multiple data items. When a node receives incoming data, it processes each item individually. For example, if a Trello node is configured to 'Create-Card' and uses an expression to set the 'Name' property from an incoming 'name-input-value', it will create a separate card for each item in the input, using the 'name-input-value' specific to the current item being processed. An input like `[{name-input-value:\"test1\"},{name-input-value:\"test2\"}]` would result in two cards being created: one named 'test1' and another named 'test2'.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Multi-item Processing", "description": "Nodes can process multiple incoming data items independently."}, {"name": "Dynamic Property Usage", "description": "Nodes use properties from the current incoming data item for processing (e.g., setting a card name from 'name-input-value')."}], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
