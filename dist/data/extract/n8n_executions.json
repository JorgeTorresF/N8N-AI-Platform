{"extracted_information": "An execution in n8n is defined as a single run of a workflow. Workflows can be run in two primary modes: Manual and Production. Manual executions are used for testing and are initiated by selecting 'Execute Workflow'; it's recommended to keep workflows Inactive during development and testing for manual runs. Production executions run automatically when the workflow is set to Active. For management and viewing, n8n provides two execution lists: 'Workflow-level executions' which displays runs for a single workflow, and 'All executions' which shows all runs across all workflows. Users can also add custom data to executions. Additionally, 'Log streaming' is available as an Enterprise feature, indicating a capability for managing or accessing execution logs.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Execution Modes", "details": [{"mode": "Manual", "description": "Used for testing workflows.
