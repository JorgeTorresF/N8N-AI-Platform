# Research Plan: N8N Platform Capabilities

## Objectives
- To provide a comprehensive overview of the N8N platform's technical capabilities.
- To assess the feasibility of replicating complex AI agent functionalities using N8N.

## Research Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge**
  - Sub-task 1.1: Understand N8N's core architecture and workflow concepts.
  - Sub-task 1.2: Research N8N's deployment options (cloud vs. self-hosted).
- **Phase 2: Core Components & Integrations**
  - Sub-task 2.1: Catalog available nodes, focusing on HTTP requests, data processing, and file operations.
  - Sub-task 2.2: Identify all supported third-party API integrations.
  - Sub-task 2.3: Investigate AI service integrations (OpenAI, Claude, other LLMs).
- **Phase 3: Advanced Features & Limitations**
  - Sub-task 3.1: Explore advanced features like sub-workflows, error handling, conditional logic, and triggers.
  - Sub-task 3.2: Identify the platform's limitations and constraints.
- **Phase 4: Practical Applications & Pricing**
  - Sub-task 4.1: Find examples of complex automation workflows.
  - Sub-task 4.2: Research current pricing models.
- **Phase 5: Synthesis & Reporting**
  - Sub-task 5.1: Consolidate all findings into a detailed report.

## Key Questions
1. What is the underlying architecture of the N8N platform?
2. What are the key nodes available for building workflows?
3. How does N8N integrate with external AI services?
4. What are the mechanisms for handling files and documents?
5. How can workflows be orchestrated and managed for complex tasks?
6. What are the error handling and debugging capabilities of N8N?
7. What triggers can initiate N8N workflows?
8. What are the known limitations and constraints of the platform?
9. Are there any community or official examples of N8N being used for AI-like tasks?
10. What are the pricing tiers and what do they include?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: N8N official documentation, N8N community forums, official blog posts and tutorials.
- Search strategies: Use targeted keywords such as "N8N architecture", "N8N nodes list", "N8N OpenAI integration", "N8N limitations", "N8N pricing", "N8N workflow examples".

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: Prioritize official N8N documentation and resources. Use at least 3 independent sources for critical facts.
- Cross-validation: Compare information from different sources (e.g., official docs, community forums, and third-party reviews) to ensure accuracy.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive markdown report detailing the findings of the research, structured according to the user's "SUCCESS CRITERIA".
- A summary of the feasibility of using N8N for AI agent replication.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search
- Justification: The task is primarily about gathering and synthesizing information from various web sources.
