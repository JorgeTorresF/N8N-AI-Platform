| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Autonomous task execution       | N8N workflows with triggers (e.g., Schedule, Webhook) and a sequence of actions.                                                                                              |
| Multi-modal processing          | N8N can handle text, and with custom nodes or HTTP requests to external APIs, it can process images and other data formats.                                                   |
| Advanced tool integration       | N8N's core strength. It can integrate with a vast number of tools and services through its nodes and HTTP Request node.                                                        |
| Adaptive learning               | This is a more advanced concept that would require a combination of N8N workflows, a database to store learning data, and an external AI service for the learning logic.        |
| Information retrieval           | N8N can retrieve information from various sources using nodes like HTTP Request, Read PDF, and by integrating with search APIs.                                                  |
| Data processing                 | N8N provides a rich set of nodes for data processing, including Set, Function, and various data manipulation nodes.                                                          |
| Code execution                  | The **Execute Command** and **Function** nodes allow for the execution of custom code (JavaScript, Python, etc.).                                                               |
