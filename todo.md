# TASK: Create N8N Workflow Automation to Replace Multiple AI Platforms

## Objective: Design and document a comprehensive N8N workflow system that can replicate capabilities from multiple leading AI platforms including:
- **Manus.im**: Autonomous AI agent with task execution, multi-modal processing, and adaptive learning
- **Lovable.dev**: AI-powered app/website creation, Figma import, community remix features
- **ChatLLM (Abacus.ai)**: Multi-LLM access, video/image generation, coding agents, workflow automation
- **MiniMax**: AGI foundation models, voice/text/image/video tools, API platform capabilities
- **General AI Agent**: Research, content generation, web development, data processing, multi-service integration

## STEPs:
[✓] STEP 1: Research N8N platform capabilities, available nodes, integrations, and limitations to understand what's technically feasible. -> Research STEP
[✓] STEP 2: Map and categorize all current AI agent capabilities into workflow-compatible components (research, content generation, file operations, API integrations, etc.). -> System STEP  
[✓] STEP 3: Design the master N8N workflow architecture with sub-workflows for different capability domains (research workflows, content generation workflows, development workflows, etc.). -> System STEP
[✓] STEP 4: Create detailed N8N workflow configurations and documentation, including node setups, API connections, and automation triggers. -> Documentation STEP

## Deliverable: 
- Complete N8N workflow documentation with step-by-step setup instructions
- Workflow JSON files ready for import into N8N
- Capability mapping showing which agent features are replicated and which have limitations
- Implementation guide for deploying the automation system

## Success Criteria:
- Workflows can handle research tasks using web APIs
- Content generation through AI service integrations
- File operations and data processing
- Multi-step automation chains
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
